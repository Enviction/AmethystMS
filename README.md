# AmethystMS v117.2 Server (Development based by Eric) 
Head developer: Wh1sk3y

Credits are given to Nexon for the creation of MapleStory, the base of our source (Development Staff) and other colaborators, as just some changes/patches on the game were applied by Wh1sk3y and Amity.

This is a Netbeans 7.4 project, that MUST be built and ran under JDK/JRE 7 in order to run properly. This means that it's easier to install the project via opening the server project folder inside Netbeans' IDE.
